# feature_quiz
Python script that generates random snippets of Python code and asks you to identify which feature the snippet represents

This script was written as part of a workshop on teaching people how to effectively incorporate AI code generation tools (Copilot, ChatGPT, etc) into their workflows. I utilized Copilot to help write much of the code in the script. As much as I would love to blame any errors in the code on Copilot, though, it's still (for the time being, at least) a human being's responsibility to decide what code gets committed.
